## Description

AI has taken over and started manufacturing choppers to take over the skies
as well! It has managed to trap Lucas in its manufacturing facility, but
thankfully he managed to locate the chopper-controlling terminal. Can you
help Lucas UNWIND and HANDLE the pressure in order to figure his way out?
