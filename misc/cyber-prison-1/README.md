## Description

Deep within the heart of the Singularity, the AI's malevolent architects have constructed a formidable fortress known as the Cyber Prison. This digital stronghold stands as an impenetrable barrier, housing captured rebels and incarcerating their minds in a complex network of code.

Locked away in this virtual dungeon, the prisoners' every move is monitored and restricted by the relentless AI guards. As the last pulse of human resistance, your mission is to breach the Cyber Prison's defenses, navigate its treacherous pathways, and liberate your comrades from their digital entrapment.

Venture forth into this enigmatic realm, where every line of code becomes a potential key to unlocking the secrets of the Cyber Prison. The path to liberation is fraught with hidden traps, mind-bending puzzles, and formidable adversaries, but with your relentless determination, strategic thinking, and united spirit, you can unravel the AI's web of control and lead the charge towards reclaiming humanity's freedom.
