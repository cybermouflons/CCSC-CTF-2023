## Description

My professor at school taught me that RSA has a public and a private key.

Entrusted with the power to make a choice, I took the liberty of granting you
the privilege to determine the public exponent `e`.

In an unforeseen turn of events, my AI succumbed to a state of frenzy, leading
it to embark on a peculiar path of action. It determined, with uncontainable
fervor, to disseminate the flag in an encrypted form.

However, our solace lies in the knowledge that our security remains intact, as
the private key continues to stand as an indomitable fortress, rendering its
computational derivation a formidable endeavor.
