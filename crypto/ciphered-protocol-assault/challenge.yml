    Infiltrating the AI-controlled territories with daring audacity, Ava had successfully gathered power traces for known plaintexts from devices encrypting vital AI communication using an implementation of AES (https://github.com/kokke/tiny-AES-c/blob/master/aes.c). These devices, unknowingly, leaked invaluable information about the AI's encryption process. 
    
    Can you use these traces to uncover the encryption key?
