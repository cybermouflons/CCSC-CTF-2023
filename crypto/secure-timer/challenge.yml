  I asked ChatCheapLeakD to implement a deterministic ECDSA scheme following
  the specifications outlined in RFC 6979. As always, its implementation surpassed
  my expectations.

  After examining the intricate generated masterpiece, I made the decision to deploy
  an online timer that utilizes the generated ECDSA implementation to sign its responses.

  Feeling a bit too confident, I went ahead and added a flag command, which returns
  the flag if provided with a valid signature. I'm willing to bet you won't be able to
  obtain the flag... or perhaps you can?
