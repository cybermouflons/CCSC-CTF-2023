# Leonhard's position model


**Category**: crypto

**Author**: tratrafe2

## Description

We found this pdf in the drive of Leonhard, a dead autonomus vehicle. We believe he used it to integrate the kinematic Single-Track Model(KS) to calculate the gathering position of its allies, and start their coup. This is backed by an old commit of a python code. However, its computation takes forever! Is there another way to approximate the gathering position?
