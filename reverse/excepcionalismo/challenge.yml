 Robots have taken over Meadowville. What was once a peaceful community nestled among the rolling hills now stood shrouded in an eerie silence.
 The towering machines with gleaming metal bodies and soulless red eyes patrolled the streets, their mechanical footsteps echoing through deserted alleyways.

 Your goal is to find a way to disrupt their control over the town. Solve the riddle and obtain the secret key that will allow humans to infiltrate their base.
 We were able to identify patterns and structures that repeat themselves at different scales, creating a complex and interconnected communication system.
 Now is your duty to help us destroy robots and bring order through chaos.
